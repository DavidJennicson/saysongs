<p>Verse 1:</p>
<p>A mighty fortress is our God,<sup>*</sup> A bulwark never failing;<sup>*</sup> Our helper he, amid the flood,<sup>*</sup> Of mortal ills prevailing.</p>

<p>Verse 2:</p>
<p>Did we in our own strength confide,<sup>*</sup> Our striving would be losing;<sup>*</sup> Were not the right man on our side,<sup>*</sup> The man of God's own choosing.</p>

<p>Verse 3:</p>
<p>And though this world, with demons filled,<sup>*</sup> Should threaten to undo us;<sup>*</sup> We will not fear, for God hath willed<sup>*</sup> His truth to triumph through us.</p>

<p>Verse 4:</p>
<p>That word above all earthly powers,<sup>*</sup> No thanks to them abideth;<sup>*</sup> The Spirit and the gifts are ours<sup>*</sup> Through him who with us sidenteth.</p>

<p>Let goods and kindred go,<sup>*</sup> This mortal life also;<sup>*</sup> The body they may kill;<sup>*</sup> God'<textdegree> 's truth abideth still,<sup>*</sup> His Kingdom is for ever.</p>
